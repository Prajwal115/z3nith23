# z3nith23
This was the website I made for Z3NITH'23. "Back to the Future" with a blend of inspiration from retrofuturism and minimalism.

The extensions of files are kept in .php so as to keep any options open, if any portal or the live-server were to be really utilised for any event.
The files were made in 2023, and there's a chance, but still a chance that it may have a few broken hyperlinks, so I hope that's not gonna be the case.

This is one of my favourite works to this day. Hope you enjoy reliving the experience of 2023.
